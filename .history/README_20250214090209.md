# Tic-Tac-Toe in React

This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using React and Vite. Players take turns placing "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. The game tracks moves, determines a winner, and allows jumping to previous moves.

## How It Works

- The game has three main components: Game, Board, and Box.
- **Game** manages the history of moves and controls turn-taking.
- **Board** displays the grid and handles user interactions.
- **Box** represents each square and updates when clicked.

## React Concepts Used

### Components

The UI is divided into reusable components. The main ones are:

- `Game.jsx` - Tracks game history and manages turns.
- `Board.jsx` - Displays the game grid.
- `Box.jsx` - Represents individual squares.

### Props

Props are used to pass data between components. The `Board` component passes values and click handlers to `Box`, allowing interaction.

### State

State keeps track of the game progress. The `Game` component manages an array of board states, allowing players to jump to previous moves.

## How to Play

1. Click a square to place "X" or "O".
2. The game updates the board and switches turns.
3. The winner is announced if three marks align.
4. Use the move list to jump to a previous turn.

## Summary

This project demonstrates:

- Breaking UI into reusable components.
- Using props to pass data.
- Managing state for real-time updates.

Feel free to modify and experiment with the game!
